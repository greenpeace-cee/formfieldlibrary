# Howto use the form field library in your extension

In this tutorial we will add the form field library to another extension. 
In this case we will add it to the Custom Forms extension. 

The custom form extension lets the administrator create new forms for data entry or data manipulation. The fields on this 
form come from the Form Field Library extension.

There are two parts which needs to be implemented in the Custom Form Extension:

1. The displaying and handling of the field it self; this is shown to the user.
2. The configuration screen of the field; this is shown to the administrator

We will start with the configuration screen and in the end we will do the displaying of the field itself.
